# Memory usage
One volume can contain 2^32 files in theory. But a needle header is 16 bytes,
size is 4 bytes, padding 8 bytes (can be 1) - so the storage overhead is at 
least 21 bytes.
So 2^32 / (21 + 1) = 195225786 files (1 byte each) can be stored in one 32Gb 
volume.

In memory the overhead is at least 16 bytes, so 195225786 * 16 = 2978Mb

# Disk-based volume index
One solution could be to store _full_ (non-changing) volumes' needle map on 
disk and search there.

## CDB
http://cr.yp.to/cdb.html could be a solution, but has some limitations: the
whole .cdb file has to be at most 2^32 bytes. Each record has 24 bytes 
overhead + 2048 bytes for hash tables + the keys.
That is (2^32 - 2048) / (24 + 16) = 107374131 records.

That means the maximum number of files (195225786) needs 2 cdb files.

But if the files are more than 8 bytes, that shrinks to 1 cdb file!


## B-tree
I've found https://bitbucket.org/santucco/btree, an on-disk B-tree 
implementation.
